# UnitTestingSandbox
Exercise: Take a (contrived) project and make it unit-test friendly

'Master' branch has the exercise to be completed.

Try to add unit tests for all methods in this solution (excluding the static Main method).  Moving methods to different classes, changing between static/dynamic, and adding interfaces is allowed and encouraged.
